A space to mess around with things that I want to learn about

Built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), [aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite), and [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

TODO:
- Set up a db and mock some data
- remove JSON placeholder
- make something interesting
